Final Project for TIY Dallas Spring '17 Cohort

Project is deployed on Herokuapp.com
https://my-movie-search-app.herokuapp.com/

My Movie Search lets a user create a user account to search for movies, tv shows, and Hollywood Stars.  
The users can view result details and save them to a favorites list.

This app was created with Create-React-App with Redux and Sass for the front-end.  
The back-end consists of Express, Node, and MongoDB.
